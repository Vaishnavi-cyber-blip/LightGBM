# LightGBM

Gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) is a widely used machine learning algorithm, due to its efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability. But with the emergence of big data, GBDT is facing new challenges, especially in the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. To tackle challenges like this new techniques were introduced in the field of data science. That helped to improve the model in terms of accuracy and speed. Here we will learn about the implementation of light GBM.
